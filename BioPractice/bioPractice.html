        <h3>About Me:</h3> 

        <p class="intro">I am a twenty-three-year-old student currently studying for my Associates degree in Software Development at the College of Western Idaho.</p> <p> My current projected graduation date is fall 2024 or spring 2025. The idea of software development first interested me because I started to realize how much coding I use in my everyday life. The idea of contributing to technologies that change my life for the better is an incredibly attractive aspect of what I am studying.</p>

        <h3>Work/Study Experience:</h3>

        <p>As of now, I have no current professional work experience as I am still pursuing my degree. My last semester of my degree offers me an internship. For school, I will be getting an associate degree in software development and will have experience in both front-end and back-end languages.</p> 

        <h3>Why Hire Me?</h3> 

        <p>Not only will I have the hard skills required for the job, but I also possess the soft skills required for the job. I am a great communicator both written and spoken, I possess the ability to work for a long time and stay focused. I enjoy puzzles and problem solving and <u class="highlight">my combination of hard and soft skills makes me a great fit for companies looking to hire entry level workers.</u></p>
