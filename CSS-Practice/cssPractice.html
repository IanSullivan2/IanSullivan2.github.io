        <h1>CIA Realizes It's Been Using Black Highlighters All These Years</h1>
        <h2>Director Demand Investigation</h2>

        <p>LANGLEY, VA---A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.</p>

            <p>According to the report, sections of the document--- "almost invariably the most crucial passages"---are marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.</p>
    
            <p>CIA Director <b>Porter Goss</b> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several historic events, such as:</p> 
        
            <ul>
                <li>the Cold War</li>
                <li>the civil-rights movement</li>
                <li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
            </ul>
